# IMPORTANT : about the location of the code
# between l10n_fr_einvoicing and l10n_fr_einvoicing_import
# The decision is the following:
# all the code that doesn't **technically** depend on account_invoice_import
# should be located in l10n_fr_einvoicing (even if the code is related to
# vendor bills). Avantages:
# 1) simplicity
# 2) we can easily support alternatives to account_invoice_import
